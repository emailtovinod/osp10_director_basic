== Red Hat OpenStack Platform Deployment Overview

Considering the multiple application stacks and its configuration requirement of OpenStack, manual deployment of Openstack is not only time-consuming but also error prone and complicated task. 

Red Hat distribution of Openstack primarily using two tools - 

*Packstack* and *Director* to deploy its distribution of Openstack. 

=== The choice of the tool to deploy the Openstack depends on multiple parameters, say;

** The purpose of the Openstack deployment
** Complexity of the Architecture
** Capacity of the Openstack infrastructure
** Configuration  Management 
** life cycle management
** future scalability requirement,  etc.



Following chapters we will go through the details and functions of both of these tools and explore them in our lab excercise also.

=== Transcript

Openstack as its name suggests, is a stack of Applications aimed to build a highly orchestrated infrastructure cloud for both public and private consumption. Unfortunately, there is no 'single command' installer to initiate the provisioning and configuration of Openstack.

Each of the enterprise Openstack distributions comes with its own Installer and configuration management tool to abstract the numerous steps involve in the deploymeny and configuration of Openstack.

Red Hat distribution of Openstack primarily coming with two tools, Packstack and Director to install and manage its distribution of Openstack.

The Operation team needs to taken multiple parameters into account while selecting the best fit tool to do their Openstack deployment.

Here are certain points which needs to be considered while choosing the Openstack instller.


** The purpose of the Openstack deployment
** Complexity of the Architecture
** Capacity of the Openstack infrastructure
** Configuration  Management 
** life cycle management
** future scalability requirement,  etc.

While proceeding to this document, we will learn about these tools,their pros and cons as well as explore their use in our lab environment too.
